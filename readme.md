## Steps of Deployment

## Steps to Run Facial Recognition
1. Run the "facepro.py" file in VS Code.
2. Open the "facepro" app on your mobile device.
3. Take a photo for facial recognition.

## Steps to Add a New Face Image
1. If you want to add new facial images, you can place the new image files in the "face-be-main/face-nn/face_dataset" folder. You can do this locally or use VS Code to complete the operation.
2. Run the "encoding.py" file in VS Code to re-encode the system and add the new photos to the facial database. Currently, the system doesn't use a database to store facial data; instead, it uses npy files to save this facial data.
